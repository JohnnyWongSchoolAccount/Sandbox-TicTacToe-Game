# INFO
- This is the tic tac toe game program that has all the algorithms including easy, medium and impossible. The TicTacToeAppEngine also includes a scoreboard, and text that indicates the state of the game. The TicTacToeAppEngine has also already been implemented into the main AppEngine as well -> https://github.com/JohnnyWongSchoolAccount/Sandbox-Hello-World
# Tic Tac Toe Algorithms
- Easy Algorithm will pick cells at random.
- Medium Algorithm will block cells when the player has created a win condition and will claim a cell if the algorithm has access to a win condition. All other moves are done at random.
- Impossible Algorithm will block cells when the player has created a win condition and will claim a cell if the algorithm has access to a win condition. The other moves are done with the intent of blocking future moves that may create win conditions for the player.
